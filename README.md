# PUG / SCSS / ES6 : Responsive Site Template

A fully responsive site theme that I coded from scratch. I didn't use any jQuery or CSS frameworks. Theres a couple small features like:

-Parallax image scrolling
-Smooth Scrolling
-Back to Top button
-mobile menu

But mostly, I was just trying to showcase my abilities to write clean, fast, cross browser compatible code. If you see something that could be improved upon, please let me know!
